There are a variety of [[Map Object Classes]] available to use when editing a tile map for SCNGame. These classes are taken in by the games code and parsed to be added to the world or scene of a game screen.

Objects can also be added to individual tiles using Tiled's collision editor. This can allow for sprite objects to hold additional collision information, as well as tiles themselves of course.

Furthermore, these object classes can make use of certain custom [[Value Types]].
