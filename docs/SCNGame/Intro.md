Welcome to SCNGame! This page is dedicated to roughing out what should be done and how we should go about doing it. It's effectively a small scratch pad for me to figure things out in terms of project management and is consequently incredibly informal.

## Development Stages

The development of SCNGame will follow two discrete stages; However, the majority of development will reside in the latter of two stages - the first is just to get things up and running.
### Pre-Dev
This stage prioritises research and prototyping to understand *what* game we should make and *how* we should make it.

It's worth noting that many of the things done here will still be done beyond pre-dev, but this stage focuses all its time on these tasks. Such tasks include:
- Determining a rough project plan and goals
- Outlining a significant set of early requirements
- Determining what tools and techniques need to be researched and learnt to facilitate development
- Learning (at least) the basis of these tools
- Producing high-fidelity prototypes using the tools - both as practice and to determine how valuable they are to the project goal
This should only consume about a months worth of development

### In-Dev
This is where the meat begins! We actually write some fricking code!!

This is the stage where 'normal' development takes place - we follow through three sub-phases building up to a significant release of the game:
- **alpha**: coding to implement a requirement with internal testing (automated and manual)
- **beta**: coding to refine an implemented requirement with external testing (play testers)
- **release candidate**: refining prior to release to ensure quality and integrity
Development will continuously cycle between these three phases.

## Development Flow
We will follow an agile approach to development following continuous integration. This means having one main-line branch to make the majority of commits to, then branching out for release.

We will loosely follow scrum development - but with much less rigidity and accounting for a much lower velocity and throughput (Casper and Nathan both have jobs outside of making this game, and a single dev can only do so much!). 
### Sprints
#### Pre-Dev Sprints
A pre-dev sprint will last 1 week.

Since pre-dev is all about initial planning and structuring - all tasks will be involved in producing prototypes and sketches, and determining a large backlog of requirements to form the 'meat' of the game. It may also include some initial formal specifications for things that *need* specifying (e.g. sprite size, engine, tools to use, etc...).

At the start of each sprint, a meeting will be held determining what work needs to be done, and who should do it. There won't be any backlog of tasks - although one of the tasks itself will be producing a backlog of requirements.
#### In-Dev Sprints
An in-dev sprint will last 2 weeks.

Each sprint will start with a meeting to determine any new product requirements, as well as analysing the pre-existing backlog. We will then allocate tasks based on the backlog and create git issues for completing these tasks.

Halfway between each sprint, we will hold an 'in-review' meeting where we discuss our current progress and if throughput needs to be adjusted or tasks altered

At the end of each sprint, I will form a sprint retrospective analysing the work of the sprint and how future work may need to change based on it.
