Haiiiiii!

This is a cool game project I'll be working on with my partner (Casper/casuoh) and my friend (Nathan) over the summer of 2024. It's nothing big, but hopefully we create something cool!

These docs are basically just to keep track of notes and other findings, as well as potentially a place to document code and class diagrams (although this will likely be quite rare).
