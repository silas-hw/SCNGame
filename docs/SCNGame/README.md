This is a cool game project I'll be working on with my partner (Casper/casuoh) and my friend (Nathan) over the summer of 2024. It's nothing big, but hopefully we create something cool!

These docs are basically just to keep track of note, document code and any technical stuff thats needed for the game. Potential dev logs and personal ramblings can also be found at [silas-hw.github.io](https://silas-hw.github.io)

These docs are made in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), and to be read properly must be opened within Obsidian.
